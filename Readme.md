Identity Bounded Context Readme - SmartSAR.BC.Identity.Infrastrucutre

The initial identity code used in this solution has been scaffolded by Visual Studio 2017 and AspNetCore2.2. 

While most of the solution is built with CQRS patterns, I've left most of the auto-generated identity code as-is and refactored or moved pieces of it to the Identity bounded context only when there was a strong reason to do so.
